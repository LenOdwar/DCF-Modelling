# 📊 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation Model  

This repository contains a **fully functional Excel-based Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model** built as part of a financial modeling course project. The model is designed to value a hypothetical company based on structured assumptions and financial projections.  

---

## 🔎 Overview  

The DCF valuation model is one of the most widely used methods in corporate finance and investment banking for estimating the intrinsic value of a company. This model is dynamic, user-friendly, and incorporates scenario analysis to help assess valuation under different assumptions.  

---

## 🛠 Features  

The model includes the following key steps:  

1. **Financial Forecasting**  
   - Profit & Loss statement items are forecasted dynamically based on assumptions.  
   - Balance Sheet items are projected using the *“days” method* for certain working capital components.  

2. **Cash Flow Modeling**  
   - Builds the **Cash Flow Statement**.  
   - Calculates **Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)** and net cash flows.  

3. **Valuation Mechanics**  
   - Discounts projected cash flows using **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**.  
   - Estimates terminal value via the **perpetuity growth method (g)**.  
   - Computes **Enterprise Value** and **Equity Value**.  

4. **Analysis Tools**  
   - **Sensitivity Analysis** for WACC and growth rate (g).  
   - **Goal Seek Analysis** for testing specific valuation scenarios.  
   - Visualization with **charts** for clear presentation.
